Okay, let’s get scraping!\n",

If we find the data we want to analyze online, we can use BeautifulSoup to grab it and turn it into a structure we can understand. This Python library, which takes its name from a song in Alice in Wonderland, allows us to easily and quickly take information from a website and put it into a DataFrame."
